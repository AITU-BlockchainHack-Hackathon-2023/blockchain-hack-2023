## Abstract

We have created a web application that allows you to view transactions in different blockchains and the connections between senders and recipients within them

## Demo video

[Link to a demo video showcasing your project, if any. Ensure it is less than 3 minutes long.]

## How to run

### Prerequisites:

- Docker

### Running

[Provide specific commands and environment for building and running your project, preferably in a containerized environment.]

Basic example:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Levap123/blockchain-hack-2023.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd blockchain hack

# Run frontend
make run_frontend_dev
```

Then go to https://localhost:9000

```bash
# you can run the backend locally
make run_backend
# but this is not required, since the frontend accesses the deployed API
```

## Future work

Our project is very flexible for additions and extensions.
